so the car build 

in the picture you see HBridge.png 

you have 4 wheels 2 on each side and in the back of the car is the h bridge 
the power ports of the hb is facing also the back 

motor a port is for the left wheels 
motor b port is for the right wheels

so so far you have base and 4 motors attached to each side of hb 

from 12v 4000 mA battery you can connect ground to ground port in hb and 12v wire to left port
also ground of battery can go to - in bread board 

and now attach a wire going from the 5v right power port of the hb to the arduino 5v and 
another ground wire to ground port of arduino 
or
attach the 5v to + in bread board and ground to - in bread board 
and from these two you can send two wires to 5v of arduino and ground in arduino 

the enable pins and the logic pins on hb

enable A(pink) - input 1(grey) - input 2(white) 
attach to arduino in 3-4-5

input 3(yellow) - input 4(green) - enable B(blue) 
attach to arduino in 7-8-9

now the arduino code which is bluetooth1.ino to arduino and attach bluetooth device

+ and - to bread board and tx to rx and rx to tx 

you can open the app on phone and play with car 

# note that there might be something wrong in wires as pins in codes are different than
pins in real car so take not of that
